# How it Works

The script works by downloading the audio file from a YouTube video and then converting it to an MP3 file. However, there is a major flaw: the resulting MP3 file lacks any or all metadata associated with the song. As a result, it does not display the song name, artist name, album name, and cover image in Spotify.

Afterward, the cover art of the song is downloaded using a link provided by you. By utilizing this image and other song data (also provided by you), the ID3 tags of the MP3 file are updated. This ensures that the correct metadata appears in the Spotify app so you can differentiate between your songs.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed on your computer.

- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) must be installed on your computer.

- [ffmpeg](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows) must be installed on your system. Keep note of where it is installed.

## Using the Script

1. Open a terminal of your choice and enter the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ypatel2022/youtube-to-spotify
   cd youtube-to-spotify
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using the command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Go to `utils.js` and find the following line of code (line 59):

   ```js
   proc.setFfmpegPath('C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe')
   ```

   Here, you want to replace `C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe` with the path of your ffmpeg binary on your system.

4. Duplicate the `example-songs.json` file and rename to `songs.json`.
   Following the layout provided in `example-songs.json`, edit and add your own songs that you want to download.

   Note: for your very last song in `songs.json`, add a duplicate of that track entry, currently there is a bug where the very last track gets corrupted when transferred to spotify.

5. Run the script using the following command and wait. It will take some time:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

6. Your spotify ready files will now be in the `/output` directory placed in a folder with the album name associated with that song. Transfer these to a directory where you want your music to be.

## Adding to Spotify

1. Check your Spotify application to ensure that your app will show songs from your local downloaded music library. If you dont know how to do this, you can check out this [guide by Spotify](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/local-files/).

2. Go to the settings page you were just on and choose the directory where you put your music.

   Note: This is only if you are desktop. The mobile version just looks at every audio file on your system.

3. You should now see the songs that you downloaded on your Spotify app in the Local File section.
